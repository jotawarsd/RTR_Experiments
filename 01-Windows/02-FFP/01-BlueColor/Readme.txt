We are not going to use any special features of c++ even though we have created a c++ file.
this is done because in future, we are going to include c++ libraries/files

We have also created a file called Build.bat
	This is called a batch file which is a combination of multiple internal commands. Running this file will run all the commands required to build our code including deleting obj, exe and res files
